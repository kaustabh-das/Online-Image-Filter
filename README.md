# Online Image Filter
 In this project I build a web app that lets you upload an image to a canvas and add filters and effects using CamanJS, then download the edited image. 
 
 I use Bootwatch, which allow us to use bootstarp theam. Put this link in the head section, by using link tag. I use Flatly. Link are below:
 Bootswatch:https://bootswatch.com/
 Flatly theam link:https://bootswatch.com/4/flatly/bootstrap.min.css
 
 In this project I use the following script. Put this script at the last of the body section.
 <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/camanjs/4.1.2/caman.full.min.js" integrity="sha512-JjFeUD2H//RHt+DjVf1BTuy1X5ZPtMl0svQ3RopX641DWoSilJ89LsFGq4Sw/6BSBfULqUW/CfnVopV5CfvRXA==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

 You will find this script link in the following link:
 camanjs:https://cdnjs.com/libraries/camanjs
